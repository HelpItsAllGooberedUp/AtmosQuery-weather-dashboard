# AtmosQuery-weather-dashboard
A lightweight, web application for self-hosting your own weather site.
It provides current weather information, along with a 2 day future forecast, for any city around the globe. 
Extremely simple, minimalist design, makes it easy to just get the information you want without any other clutter.
No ads, no videos autoplaying at max volume (The Weather Channel - My Nemesis. >:( )

## ABOUT

API service: [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.WeatherAPI.com)

Icons: [erikflowers-weather-icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

AtmosQuery relies on WeatherAPI for real-time and forecast data. Weather conditions are displayed with visual icons provided by Erik Flowers’ free weather icon set.

# Setup Instructions

1. Aqquire a personal API key from WeatherAPI
Create a free account on WeatherAPI￼ and generate a personal API key. You can choose to either store the key in a .env file or paste it directly into app.py.

If you want to bypass environment variables for simplicity:
```python

from dotenv import load_dotenv # <- DELETE THIS 
load_dotenv() #<- DELETE THIS

#CHANGE THIS LINE
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")

#TO THIS
API_KEY = "paste your key here"
```

if you plan to put your version of AtmosQuery out on the web, you must put your API key in a dotenv.

2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:
` git clone https://github.com/HelpItsAllGooberedUp/AtmosQuery-weather-dashboard.git `

`cd AtmosQuery-weather-dashboard`

3. Set up a virtual environment and ensure you haver the neccesary requirements
you may like to copy and paste the following into your terminal
while still in the project directory:

the virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate`

* What the heck is a virtual environment?*
A virtual environment is necessary to isolate the app's Python dependencies from your own systems installation of Python. :) 


all requirements are listed in requirements.txt
* Flask -micro web framework
* requests -for fetching api data
* python-dotenv -for API key security

to automatically install all requirements in a single command:
within the directory, run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the application
`flask run`

By default, the app will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/.`
Visit this in a browser to view the site.

NOTE: By default, the app is only accessible on your local machine. To allow access from other devices on your local network, run:
`flask run --host=0.0.0.0`
Then visit `http://<your-local-ip>:5000/` on another device on the same network.


# Usage
____
1.	Enter a city name, zip code, or city/state/country combination in the search bar.
2.	Press Enter or click the search button.
3.	View the current weather and forecast for the requested location.

Supported formats include:
•	City, State (e.g., Boston, MA)
•	Zip Code (US only)
•	City, Province/State, Country (e.g., Toronto, Ontario, Canada)

Searches are forgiving — case and spacing do not affect results
(this is especially important for when I dont remember how to spell Massachusetts ;) )

# Directory Explanation
Icons are kept within Static > Images > Icons.
There are currently many more icons there, than were used for now. I plan to implement them later.

"Data" folder is an example of Weather API's standard codes for specifying the weather condition.
I used this when creating "condition_icons.py" but it can be referenced if ever redoing the icons.


# Simple Customization
 Try out changing the color scheme. 
 All colors are specified in the one css file. 
 If you make my UI actually look really good, please let me know haha. 

# Contributing
________
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:
1.	Fork the repository.
2.	Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature-name.
3.	Make changes and commit: git commit -am "Add feature".
4.	Push to branch: git push origin feature-name.
5.	Submit a pull request.


# Final Info
This was created as a final project for Harvards CS50 course: "Introduction to Computer Science & the Art of Programming"
Therefore, its not particularly practical to use, but later on, perhaps it will be something actually useful. 
If you are here because you are a fellow CS50 student, and you want someone to work on a project with, so we can both learn and practice, let me know!


if you dont want to self host this (I wouldnt want to either)
